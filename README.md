# Raydium Token Swap Script

## About
This Python script facilitates token swaps on the Raydium decentralized exchange platform. It demonstrates interaction with blockchain networks, smart contract calls, and handling of decentralized finance (DeFi) operations.

## Features
- Performs token swaps on the Raydium platform
- Implements slippage protection
- Calculates and checks price impact before executing swaps
- Interacts with Solana blockchain and Raydium smart contracts
- Provides error handling and transaction confirmation

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Web3.py for blockchain interaction
- Solana library for Solana blockchain specifics
- Asyncio for asynchronous operations

## How It Works
1. The script connects to the Solana network.
2. It loads the Raydium swap contract using the provided ABI and address.
3. The user inputs the token addresses, amount to swap, and desired settings.
4. The script calculates the expected output based on current prices.
5. It checks if the price impact is within the specified limit.
6. If all checks pass, it constructs and sends the swap transaction.
7. The script waits for transaction confirmation and reports the result.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Solana wallet with sufficient SOL for gas fees
- Token balances for the swap

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install web3 solana
3. Set up your Solana wallet and obtain the private key
4. Update the RAYDIUM_SWAP_ABI and RAYDIUM_SWAP_ADDRESS in the script
5. Run the script:
   python raydium_token_swap.py
6. Follow the prompts to input swap details

## Configuration
Update the following variables in the script:
- RAYDIUM_SWAP_ABI: The ABI of the Raydium swap contract
- RAYDIUM_SWAP_ADDRESS: The address of the Raydium swap contract
- YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY: Your Solana wallet's private key

## Sample Usage
Enter the token address to swap from: TOKEN_A_ADDRESS
Enter the token address to swap to: TOKEN_B_ADDRESS
Enter the amount to swap: 100
Enter the minimum amount to receive: 95
Enter the slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.01 for 1%): 0.01
Enter the maximum price impact (e.g., 0.05 for 5%): 0.05

## Limitations
- This script interacts with live blockchain networks and involves financial transactions. Use with caution.
- The accuracy of price calculations depends on up-to-date price oracles.
- Network congestion can affect transaction speed and gas fees.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a user interface for easier interaction
- Add support for multiple DEXs and cross-chain swaps
- Integrate with wallet services for easier key management
- Implement advanced trading features like limit orders and dollar-cost averaging

## Risks and Disclaimers
- Cryptocurrency trading involves significant risk. Only use this script if you understand these risks.
- This script interacts with smart contracts. Ensure you trust the contract addresses and ABIs used.
- Always verify transaction details before confirming.
- The authors are not responsible for any financial losses incurred using this script.

## Ethical Considerations
This tool is designed for educational and personal use. Be aware of and comply with all relevant financial regulations in your jurisdiction when using this script.
